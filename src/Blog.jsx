        <h2 style={{ color: "#BF5700" }}>Scatterplot Overview (August 2025)</h2>
        <p>
          The Longhorn Cards and Collectibles proprietary scatterplot allows for the analysis of player Composite Rankings, 
          Fundamental Rankings, Technical Rankings, and Sentiment Rankings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plot area is color coded to better understand quadrants that include players with the strongest rankings, with green, blue,
          yellow, and red coloring.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key to understanding how to read the scatterplot is to know that higher ranking players, on average, should lead to 
          stronger and more consistent card prices over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, players in the green shaded area exhibit the highest current rankings, and many of these players are future
            hall-of-fame contenders with strong historical career statistics and are well known to the broad public.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scatterplot can be used to both evaluate current cards to purchase as well as which ones to avoid until their underlying
            rankings improve and offer more of a balance between risk and reward.

      <article style={entryStyle}>
        <h2 style={{ color: "#BF5700" }}>Sentiment Rankings (August 2025)</h2>
        <p>
          Sentiment Rankings are based on Google Trends data, and the rankings provide a sense of how relevant and popular 
          the respective players are versus other players.
        </p>
        <p>
          On average, players that are more popular will garner a larger fanbase, and that fanbase is more likely to purchase 
          that player's sports cards as opposed to a player that is relatively unknown or even disliked.
        </p>
        <p>
          This measure of sentiment can be a critical factor as it makes the market for that player much larger, and should lead 
          to stronger and more stable prices over time with a higher level of market liquidity.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this example, you can see how LeBron James has held a very high and consistent sentiment ranking, whereas Tyler Herro 
            and Victor Wembanyama have been more volatile since they are younger players.  Furthermore, "Shoeless" Joe Jackson has a 
            relatively low sentiment ranking primarily because he's been deceased a long time and doesn't garner as much attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sentiment rankings are a critical part of our proprietary Composite Ranking in order to gauge the potential market for that 
            player as well as the future price potential for their cards over the longer term.

        <h2 style={{ color: "#BF5700" }}>Understanding Rankings (August 2025)</h2>
        <p>
          Longhorn Cards and Collectibles calculates a number of different rankings that help gauge the overall strength and 
          quality of a sports player for determining potential card price appreciation over the longer term.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Composite Rank is a combination of Technical Rank (based on historical card prices), Sentiment Rank (based on Google Trends), 
          and Fundamental Rank (based on player's career statistics).
        </p>
        <p>
          The combination of these different rankings, along with changes to a players fundamentals (statistics), helps to 
          determine if that card should be purchased.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, Fundamental Change is an important variable that compares the player's most recent season versus their historical 
            average season to determine if they are outperforming, which should lead to robust card price returns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, the rankings provide a quantitative way to evaulate players based on numerous criteria in order to determine if they 
            are suitable for your collection.

        <p>
          Geno Smith has executed on the field the past few years, with a breakout season last year. Last year's success resulted in
          Fundamental Change according to our calculation of 153% versus his career average, and as a result his card prices are up
          over 300% the past year.
        </p>

          Since 2014, his cards have returned 1115% according to Card Ladder. Geno's cards look primed to continue advancing higher depending
          on his performance on the field this year with the Las Vegas Raiders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Longhorn Cards and Collectibles currently rates Geno as a Buy due to a Technical Rank of 100 and above-average Composite and Sentiment ranks.

        <p>
          This is a list of sports card grading companies with their respective non-bulk minimum prices, estimated turnaround time, and maximum 
          insured values.
         </p>
         <p> 
          Per ChatGPT, top-tier grading companies are PSA, BGS, SGC, and CGC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mid-tier grading companies are HGA, TAG, ISA, GMA, and MNT.
         </p>
         <p>
            Finally, low-tier grading companies include RCG, FCG, PGI, WCG, and the others listed and not listed.
         </p>
         <p>
            Despite the higher price, PSA has been shown to provide the highest value for their graded cards versus all other grading companies.
         </p>
         <p>
            However, there are exceptions of course because BGS, SGC, and CGC are top-tier companies similar to PSA.

        <h2 style={{ color: "#BF5700" }}>Top Sports Card Grading Companies (August 2025)</h2>
        <p>
          PSA, BGS, SGC, and CGC are the top-tier sports card grading companies according to ChatGPT and other online sources.
         </p>
         <p> 
          This overview provides a summary for each company, detailed pricing, turnaround time information, and details about their process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on non-bulk pricing, currently BGS and SGC are tied for the cheapest minimum price per card, while SGC offers the most attractive turnaround time at base pricing.
         </p>
         <p>
            Each grading company provides a different value proposition as well as different encapsulations (slabs) that may be appealing to different people.
         </p>
         <p>
            PSA assigns grades based on different qualifiers using a process that is mostly objective, and their branded LightHouse 
            Label provides full information including the grade and card details. 
         </p>
         <p>
            BGS is especially renowned for grading newer cards, and assigns grades based on four subgrades:  centering, corners, edges, and surface.
            They are known for their classy encapsulation design called the BGS Case Diagram.
         </p>
         <p>
          SGC has build a reputation for its focus on older, vintage cards - especially historic baseball trading cards and memorabilia.  They are known 
          for their straight-forward grading scale and fast turnaround times, with a distinctive tuxedo-like black matting within their encapsulation.
         </p>
         <p>
          CGC is a newer entrant to sports card grading and they are leveraging their expertise from grading comic books.  They employ a team effort 
          with advanced technology, and they stand out for their state-of-the-art encapsulation design.

        <p>
          This Berkshire Hathaway 1999 Annual Meeting pass is autographed by Warren Buffett and comes with a Letter  of Authenticity.  
          Please visit my eBay store to make an offer.  
         </p>
         <p> 
          This meeting occurred right in the middle of the Dot-com bubble, and Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger spent much of the meeting defending 
          their decision not to invest in internet/technology companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Per ChatGPT, during the meeting many shareholders pressed them on why Berkshire Hathaway was avoiding the "new economy".
         </p>
         <p>
          Warren Buffett reiterated his philosphy of only invesing in businesses he understood, while emphasizing durable 
          competitive advantages, predictable cash flows, and reasonable valuations - all of which most technology companies during 
          that time lacked as they did not have proven business models.
         </p>
         <p>
          During the meeting, Warren Buffett acknowledged all the excitement around the internet but warned about "speculative fever".
         </p>
         <p>
          A quote from Warren Buffett at a different time best reflects the sentiment of this meeting:  "Buy into a company because 
          you want to own it, not because you want the stock to go up."
